# Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy — lean_c

## Purpose
Ensure project decisions and spending are free from undue influence by personal, financial, or organizational interests and that any potential conflicts are disclosed and managed transparently.

## Scope
Applies to the maintainer, core contributors, and anyone involved in decisions related to roadmap, reviews, procurement, or expenditure of sponsored funds.

## Definitions
A conflict of interest (COI) arises when personal relationships, employment, or financial interests could reasonably be perceived to affect impartial judgment in project matters.

## Disclosure
- Individuals must disclose potential COIs in the relevant GitHub Issue/PR and via email to the maintainer.
- Disclosures should specify the nature of the interest and the affected decision.

## Recusal & Review
- Individuals with a COI will recuse themselves from the affected decision.
- The maintainer (and advisors if appointed by the fiscal sponsor) will review disclosures and document the resolution in Issues/PRs.

## Controls for Sponsored Funds
- Expenditures require public documentation (Issue/PR) and at least two approvals (maintainer + reviewer).
- Monthly/quarterly reports include a COI section noting disclosures and resolutions.

## Recordkeeping
COI disclosures and decisions are recorded in the repository via Issues/PRs and referenced in periodic reports.

## Policy Updates
Reviewed annually or upon changes requested by the fiscal sponsor.
